# pico-usb-ethernet

Ethernet over USB for the Raspberry Pi Pico RP 2040.

## Motivation

I have several Raspberry Pi Pico development boards based on the RP 2040.
These boards do not include Wifi or Bluetooth capabilities. The only
means for communication is the USB connection to the host computer.

The goal of this project is to experiment with UDP-over-USB to provide
a more convenient communication mechanism between the Pico and the host
computer. I want to be able to plug my Pico into my laptop and be able
to send messages and receive messages.

I have found that three requirements must be met for my use case:

- The Pico appears to the host compiler as a network interface.

- The Pico has a static IP address (arbitrarily hardcoded to 192.168.7.1)
because my laptop does not run a DHCP server.

- The Pico has to run its own DHCP server. The DHCP server assigns a
local IP address to the host computer. The host computer acts as a
gateway to the rest of the network. In particular, the Pico can
send messages to virtual machines running on the host.

## Building

1. Clone the repository.
2. Initialize the pico-sdk submodule:

        pushd pico-sdk/
        git submodule update --init
        popd

3. Build `pico-usb-ethernet.uf2`:

        mkdir build
        cmake -S . -B build
        cmake --build build

4. Build associated tools:

        pushd tools/
        mkdir build
        cmake -S . -B build
        cmake --build build
        popd

## Use

Install `build/pico-usb-ethernet.uf2` on your Raspberry Pi Pico by
copying it to the Pico when then Pico is in boot mode. For example,
on macOS:

    cp build/pico-usb-ethernet.uf2 /Volumes/RPI-RP2

The Pico reboots and runs the program.

By default, the Pico registers itself under the hardcoded IP address
192.168.7.1. It echos UDP packets sent to port 12345, and sends
periodic health updates to the hardcoded IP address 192.168.64.47
and port 12345 (because that's the local address of my host computer).
Adjust these addresses and ports in [./src/main.c](./src/main.c) to match your set-up.

Use the tools in the [./tools/](./tools/) folder to talk to the Pico:

    ./tools/build/echo 192.168.7.1 12345

Sends a message to the Pico and prints the response (echo).

    ./tools/build/health 12345

Prints the health updates that the Pico sends to the host computer.
Currently, that's only the Pico's IP address and hostname.
